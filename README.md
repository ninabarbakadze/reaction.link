## Running this project
- Fork & clone this repo
- Run npm i in Client and Server to install necessary dependencies
- Run npm run start to start the front-end
- Run npm run dev to start the back-end server 
- I've already set up everything in the back-end config so no neeed to adjust environment variables.
